How to Run Program:-
For linux/unix/OsX based system run
sh assign2.sh
For windows based system double click on assign2.bat
I have also include jar file with the project
You can run using command
java -jar AIAssignment2.jar

Compilation and Execution
I have created this project using java, To view code you can use Intellij to load the project.
This program has been tested for following matrix
1.)
1 3 4
8 0 2
7 6 5
Input (1,3,4,8,0,2,7,6,5)
DFS depth -5

2.)
2 8 3
1 6 4
7 0 5
Input (2,8,3,1,6,4,7,0,5)
DFS depth -6

3.)
1 2 3
8 4 0
7 6 5
Input (1,2,3,8,4,0,7,6,5)
DFS depth - 30

Details:
This program implements 8-puzzle solver. It uses 3 techniques
1. BFS (BFSAlgorithm.java)
2. DFS (DFSAlgorithm.java)
3. Best first with Heuristic (AstarAlgorithm.java)

PuzzleState.java maintains state of puzzle state, It saves an ArrayList of parent nodes of current Puzzle states.
It also does following functions:-
1. Create children nodes from parent node
2. Calculates different Heuristics functions like out of place, minimum moves and Manhattan dist + 3* totseq
3. It also helps in priority queue by using comparator this helps in sorting of the Priority queue
